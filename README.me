NetPIDTracer is a lightweight, open-source Python tool designed to trace active network connections (`netstat` output) along with their associated **Process IDs (PIDs)** and **full executable paths** on Linux systems.

## 🔍 Features

- List all active TCP/UDP connections
- Show local and remote addresses with port numbers
- Match each connection with the process PID
- Display the full file path of the process executable
- Easy to use, no external dependencies (pure Python)

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Linux-based OS (Tested on Ubuntu/Debian)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the tool using:
```bash
python3 netpidtracer_en.py
```

Example output:
```
[+] Protocol: tcp	Local Address: 127.0.0.1:631	Remote Address: 0.0.0.0:0	PID: 982	Path: /usr/sbin/cupsd
```
